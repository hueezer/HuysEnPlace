Meanwhile, preheat the oven to Bake 450F (no fan, bottom only if possible) with 2 trays, one with lava rocks.\n\nOnce the dough has grown 2.5 to 3 times in size, and the oven has preheated bowl a pot of water.  Score the loaves with a lame or razor.  Immediately spray with water after scoring.\n\nPlace the baguette pans with the dough into the oven. Immediately pour boiling water onto lava rocks and secondary tray.\n\nBake for 8 minutes without opening the door.\n\nOpen the door to release any leftover steam, and bake 7-8 minutes depending on desired color.\n\nRemove the Bánh Mì from the oven and let cool.
